        "value": "The Water Analytics App is based on PHOEBE's DigiWATER App, and aims to reveal the importance of the WDME in serving Digital Twin functionality and analytics algorithms at the application layer. The app provides functionality for importing multiple EPANET water network models and linking their components (pipes, junctions, tanks, etc.) to sensors that measure various hydraulic and quality characteristics, like pressure, flow, chlorine residual, etc. The app offers a suite of advanced analytics tools designed to enhance water quality monitoring and management. These tools include hydraulic state estimation, which helps assess and predict pressure and flow dynamics across the water distribution network; water quality state estimation for tracking chlorine residuals and other water quality indicators; and contamination detection algorithms that identify potential contamination events in real time. Additional tools include sensor placement optimisation for both pressure and chlorine sensors, leakage detection, and chlorine injection scheduling. These analytics capabilities enable water utilities to make data-driven decisions, optimise the network performance, and ensure compliance with water quality regulations."
