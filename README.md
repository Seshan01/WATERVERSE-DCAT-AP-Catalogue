# DCAT-AP data model

The DCAT-AP standard will be used to define the metadata of different Entities, datasets, and data services, ensuring structured and interoperable descriptions for each of them.

# Project strcuture 

The project will be organized into three folders that align with the requirements of WATERVERSE Pilot projects:

-  **Datasets**
-  **Entity Data**  
-  **Data Services** 

For each Datasets, Entity Data &amp; Data Services, there will be two folders per pilot corresponding to:
-  The repository of the corresponding **Data Model**. 
-  A json file of the metadata based on the **DCAT-AP** specification.
